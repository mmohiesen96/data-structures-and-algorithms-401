# Singly Linked List
- Is a linear data structure that consists of nodes and each node have the data that it hold and the reference to the next node ,
Nodes are cinnected using the next reference which can be scattered and doesn't need to have the adjacent references .

## Challenge
- Implement the linked list using the node and linked list classes .

## Approach & Efficiency
Used Classes to implement the linked list with the O(1) and O(n) for it's methods .

## API
#### Insert Method : Inserts a new node at the head of the linked list .
###### args(T data)
#### Clear Method : Clears the linked list from nodes .
###### args()
#### includes Method : Searches for a specific key in the linked lists .
###### args(T key)
#### toString (Over rided) Method :
###### args()
#### kthFromEnd Method : find the element index from the end of the linked list .
##### args (T index)

#### zipLists Method : merge two linked lists and return a new merged linked lists .
##### args (LinkedList<T> , LinkedList<T>)
